- buttonLED.js
This program reads values from the four buttons on the breadboard, and lights up a respective LED when a button is pressed. 
When executing the program, the user should observe that a LED lights up for the duration which the button is pressed. 

- HW2_etch_and_sketch.js
This program is an extension of buttonLEd.js, and incorporates the etch and sketch program from homework 1. The five buttons on the breadboard represent the four directions and reset. When a button is pressed, a respective LED lights up, and 'x' is "etched" into a 8x8 grid printed on the screen. No response will be triggered if the user attempts to move outside of the range of the grid. The fifth button is a reset button, which will clear the grid when pressed.
